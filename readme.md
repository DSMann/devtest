# Interview Packet

## Thank you!
First, I want to reach out and thank you for applying for employment at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! Good luck as you accomplish the tasks below.

## Overview of the tasks
Depending on the position you are applying for you will have a choice on which tasks you complete.
For all of them, there are a few things to do:
* To start fork the repo.
* Use the spec sheet for details you may need, if there is something missing feel free to email questions.
* Create a tag after you have developed for 1hr and then at 3hr called 1hr and 3hr respectivly.
* Submit a Pull Request when all chosen tasks are completed.

In the Folder there are several assets that are needed for different tasks. There is text to enter and images to use. I am not worried about which images go where, or what text is used. In fact, if you need one, http://dustinsenos.com/littleIpsum, is a great lorem ipsum generator for the mac and all the images are from unsplash.

Please keep in mind as you are coding these tasks that we are an enterprise level development team and need to be thinking about maintainability, sharability, and footprint. Initial load as well as overall page size is important.

### Task levels
There are three levels for these tasks, entry, mid-sr level, and Lead. We will be keeping in mind your level, so don't be nervous, just relax and code and have fun.

#### Entry Level
If you are applying for an internship through an entry level position (usually levels 1-2):
* Code up the article
* and choose one other task to code. (pick the one you feel most comfortable doing, or one you want to learn something with.)

#### Mid to Senior
If you are applying for a mid to senior level position (usually levels 3-4):
* Code up the article
* Choose two other tasks to code. I'll want to know why you chose the ones you did.

#### Lead and above
If you are applying for a Lead or above position (usually level 5):
* You don't get a choice, code all tasks please, I'll have a bunch of questions for you after.
* Think of it as the start of a system.

### The Tasks
So without further ado, here are your tasks. Use the images as a design comp. These are a little scant on details on purpose.
